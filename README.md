# Xmrig Embedded Executable Example

This is a simple example of using Rust to include a compiled executable into your program, then when
the program is run, to write that executable to a temporary directory and run the program.

See the [example](./examples/run.rs) for how to use it.

You should be able to run xmrig on Windows and Linux by cloning this repo and running:

```bash
cargo run --example run
```
